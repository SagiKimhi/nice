 <div class="CBody"><p>A chained sequencer is a sequencer component that can be used in the same way by receiving items from a sequence and sending them in the form of requests to a driver, but it can also be connected to one or more chained sequencers, forming a chain of sequencers, which is where its name comes from.</p><p>One advantage of this unorthodox approach is there is no one giant class that needs to maintain the complete protocol hierarchy. Each chaining sequence can manage its own level of the protocol, which can simplify design and debug.</p><p>Secondly, multiple chained sequences may operate in parallel on the same chained sequencer. By using varying priority levels, this further isolates the different tasks between the levels of the protocol.</p><p>A third advantage is that one can break the chain at any point and send its request items either directly into a driver, or skip the DUT altogether and send them via TLM ports directly to the corresponding chained sequencer. This allows engineers to simulate the design at different levels of abstraction.</p><p>To better understand this are a few terms to familiarize yourself with.</p><table class="CDefinitionList"><tr><td class="CDLEntry">Upstream</td><td class="CDLDefinition"><p>the upstream refers to anything that represents the data and the protocol in a higher level of abstracton, relative to this level.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="CDLEntry">Downstream</td><td class="CDLDefinition"><p>the downstream refers to anything that represents the data and the protocol as a lower level of abstracton, relative to this level.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="CDLEntry">Requests</td><td class="CDLDefinition"><p>Sequence items that go from upstream to downstream (towards the driver, through one are more chained sequencers).</p></td></tr><tr><td class="CDLEntry">Traffic</td><td class="CDLDefinition"><p>Sequence items that are monitored and have been received by the agent.
